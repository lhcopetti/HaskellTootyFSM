# TootyHaskellFSM

#### This is a homework for my Post-Graduation course in Game Development.

The task was to implement an FSM using as baseline one villain from a video game of your choosing. I decided to honor a game from my childhood: The [Tooty The Feeble](http://croc.wikia.com/wiki/Tooty_the_Feeble) from [Croc: Legend of the Gobbos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croc:_Legend_of_the_Gobbos).

I have had a lot of help from a post I came across while researching on [how to implement FSMs in Haskell](https://wickstrom.tech/finite-state-machines/2017/11/10/finite-state-machines-part-1-modeling-with-haskell.html). I haven't had the opportunity to read it all, but judging from Part 1 and 2, it is **defintely** a hell of series!
